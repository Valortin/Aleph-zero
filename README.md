# Aleph Zero: Scalable, Privacy-Centered Blockchain Layer 1

## Overview
Aleph Zero is a Layer 1 blockchain designed for privacy, scalability, low fees, and quick transaction speeds. It addresses limitations in existing distributed ledger technology by providing high-speed, privacy-centric, and scalable solutions suitable for a range of industries.

## What It Does
- **Privacy-Centered:** Provides robust privacy features for transactions and smart contracts.
- **High Scalability:** Achieves up to 100,000 transactions per second (TPS) in simulated environments.
- **Low Transaction Fees:** Ensures minimal costs for transactions, averaging around 0.0003 AZERO.
- **Fast Transaction Speeds:** Delivers quick validation times, making it comparable to regular internet speeds.

## The Problem It Solves
Aleph Zero tackles the shortcomings of current distributed ledger technologies, such as slow transaction times and high costs, by utilizing innovative solutions to enhance speed, privacy, and scalability.

## Challenges Encountered
- Integrating Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology with blockchain to improve throughput.
- Maintaining high decentralization while optimizing performance.

## Technologies Used
- **Consensus Mechanism:** AlephBFT
- **Data Structure:** Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)
- **Blockchain Framework:** Substrate stack
- **Programming Language:** Rust
- **Decentralized Storage:** IPFS
- **Privacy Layer:** Liminal

## How We Built It
Aleph Zero was developed using Parityâ€™s Substrate framework in Rust. It combines the AlephBFT consensus for secure transaction validation with a DAG structure for rapid processing.

## What We Learned
Through the development of Aleph Zero, we discovered effective methods to balance privacy, decentralization, and scalability, achieving nearly instant transaction validation without compromising security.

## What's Next for Aleph Zero
We aim to expand our ecosystem with new tools, enhance smart contracts with additional privacy features, and extend use cases across various industries to drive Web3 innovation.
